\begin{abstract} % 300 word limit
For this research project we profiled and optimised the \textbf{Contur} software package. This thesis outlines the tools used to carry out and visualise the profiling results.
Additionally it outlines the subsequent optimisation changes made to \textbf{Contur} based off the results seen in the profiles. On the test data we ran the profile on, the optimisation changes
implemented achieved a factor of 5 speed up in runtime (pre-optimisation runtime of around 20 minutes, post optimisation runtime of just below 4 minutes).
