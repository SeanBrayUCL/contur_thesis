\chapter{Profiling Contur}
\label{chapterlabel3}

In this chapter we will outline the tools used to profile contur and view the results. We will then conclude by presenting the results of the initial profile of contur which was performed before any optimization was performed. This initial profile can be taken as our base for assessing the effectiveness of optimization work later carried out on contur.
